If you elect such a plan, then, once you subscribe, your Subscription Account will renew automatically on a periodic basis (e.g., month-to-month for our monthly plan) and you will be billed each subscription period unless and until you cancel your Subscription Account or we terminate your use of the Platform pursuant to our <a href="/terms">Terms of Use</a>. You may cancel your subscription at any time by navigating to the "Manage Your Account" page on the Platform.</li>\n        <li>- In order to avoid being charged fees for the next billing cycle, you must cancel your Subscription Account prior to 12:00 a.m. Eastern Time on the last day of your current billing cycle.</li>\n        <li>- All fees for Subscription Accounts are prepaid and non-refundable. You may cancel your Subscription Account or terminate your use of the Platform entirely at any time, but you will not receive a refund or credit for any fees previously paid.</li>\n        <li>- Upon cancellation, you will retain access to your Subscription Account for the remainder of the subscription period for which you previously paid.</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p><strong>Enrollment &amp; Account Type</strong></br>\n    We may offer different tiers or types of Subscription Account. The types of available Subscription Account and the fees for and benefits of each type will be as described on the Platform. Unless otherwise expressly stated on the Platform, all fees are listed in, and will be charged in, United States Dollars.</p>\n    <p>Some of types of Subscription Accounts that we offer will expire at the conclusion of the original subscription period, unless affirmatively renewed by the subscriber. Other types of Subscription Account, like our monthly subscription, will renew automatically at the conclusion of each subscription period. If you elect such a plan, then, once you subscribe, your Subscription Account will renew automatically on a periodic basis (e.g., month-to-month for our monthly plan) and you will be billed each subscription period unless and until you cancel your Subscription Account or we terminate your use of the Platform pursuant to our <a href="/terms">Terms of Use</a>. You may cancel your subscription at any time by navigating to the "Manage Your Account" page on the Platform and following the on-screen links and instructions to cancel, as described below.</p>\n    <p>You will not be able to change the type/tier of your Subscription Account once subscribed. If you later wish to subscribe to a Subscription Account of a different type or tier, you will need to cancel your current Subscription Account and begin a new one.</p>\n    <p>Billing for Accounts Created Directly with ABCya</p>\n    <p>You will be required to provide valid payment card information as part of your creation of a Subscription Account. (ABCya may limit the type of payment cards accepted as described during the checkout process or otherwise on the Platform.) The fees for your Subscription Account (plus any applicable taxes) will be billed to the payment card you provide when you initially subscribe or shortly thereafter. If you have selected an auto-renewing plan, then your Subscription Account will automatically renew each subscription period and ABCya will bill the payment card then associated with your Subscription Account on the calendar day corresponding to the commencement of your Subscription Account, unless and until you cancel. For example, if you sign up for a monthly Subscription Account on January 1, your date of first renewal would be February 1. In the event you sign up for a monthly Subscription Account on a calendar day not contained in any subsequent month, your account will renew (and your payment card will be billed) on the last day of such month. For example, if you were to create a monthly Subscription Account on March 31, your account would next be billed on April 30.</p>\n    <p>It is your responsibility to keep your billing and contact information up-to-date. You may change the payment card associated with your account at any time by visiting the Manage Your Account page on the Platform. If your payment card is declined during the renewal process or we are otherwise unable to process a transaction using your payment card, we will terminate your Subscription Account following the conclusion of the last period for which you completed payment.

In order to avoid being charged for the next billing cycle, you must cancel your Subscription Account prior to 12:00 a.m. Eastern Time on the last day of your current billing cycle.</p>\n    <p>To cancel your Subscription Account, navigate to the "Manage Your Account" page on the Platform, select the "Cancel my subscription" or similar button, and follow all on-screen instructions and links to complete the cancellation process.</p>\n    <p>All fees for Subscription Accounts are prepaid and non-refundable. You may cancel your Subscription Account at any time, but you will not receive a refund or credit for any fees previously paid. Upon cancellation, you will immediately lose access to your Subscription Account.</p>\n    <p><strong>Consent to Receipt of Electronic Records</strong></br>\n    Following your enrollment in a Subscription Account, an email will be sent to the email address your provide during the check-out process confirming your account type and, if you have elected an account type that renews automatically, your authorization for ABCya to bill the subscription fee to your payment card each billing cycle. We may send additional emails regarding your account during your subscription. The confirmation email and other notices about your account may only be sent via email in electronic form. By signing up for a Subscription Account, you consent to receiving notices regarding your Subscription Account electronically.

Like many teachers, they were excited to share the joys of education with their classrooms. Unfortunately, like many teachers, they quickly discovered that finding quality resources to help students succeed was a challenge, and that the school’s budget was stretched too thin to purchase new learning software to supplement their lesson plans.</p>\n    <p>The free online options weren’t a good choice, either. In Alan’s words, they were “a never-ending labyrinth of sites for kids loaded with violence, difficult navigation, and inappropriate ads!” However, Alan remained undaunted. His self-taught knowledge of programming and previous experience as a graphic designer prepared him to take matters into his own hands.</p>\n    <p>With a plan to gamify educational lessons, Alan developed several learning activities for his computer classes. He came up with a fun domain name—ABCya.com—to host his games, and began using them with his students. Before long, he noticed that other teachers were also using his website in their own classes, not realizing that its creator was one of their colleagues!</p>\n    <p>Alan continued to develop and perfect games for ABCya.com, eventually venturing into the creation of stand-alone apps. In 2011, his Math BINGO app soared to the top of the educational category in the iTunes store. It was also featured on Apple’s website and installed on demo iPads at hundreds of Apple retail stores across the U.S. Today, millions of users each month play ABCya’s desktop games and apps, logging over a billion games played just in 2017.</p>\n    <p>As VP of ABCya, Lisa relies on her experience as an educator, and as a parent, to keep ABCya dedicated to the company’s founding principles: creating educational games that keep learning fun.</p>",join:"Join the Story!"},team:{title:["MEET THE TEAM","Meet the Team"],subtitle:"We are ABCya!",jobs:{management:["FOUNDER","VICE PRESIDENT","DIRECTOR OF PRODUCTS/COMPOSER"],support:["CUSTOMER SUPPORT"],design:["GAME ARTIST","ART DIRECTOR","ASSOC.
